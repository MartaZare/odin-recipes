    <p>
      Focaccia is widely used in various italian recipes. It is light flavourful
      bread with olive oil, garlic and rosemary.

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>512 g flour</li>
      <li>10 g salt</li>
      <li>8 g instant yeast</li>
      <li>455 g lukewarm water</li>
      <li>butter for greasing</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons olive oil (divided)</li>
      <li>flaky salt</li>
      <li>rosemary leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and instant yeast. Add
        the water. Using a rubber spatula, mix until the liquid is absorbed and
        the ingredients form a sticky dough ball. Rub the surface of the dough
        lightly with olive oil. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, cloth bowl
        cover, or plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator immediately for at
        least 12 hours or for as long as three days.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line 23×33 cm pan with parchment paper or grease with butter or coat
        with nonstick cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour a tablespoon of oil into the center of each pan or 2 tablespoons of
        oil if using the pan. Using two forks, deflate the dough by releasing it
        from the sides of the bowl and pulling it toward the center. Rotate the
        bowl in quarter turns as you deflate, turning the mass into a rough
        ball. Place one piece into one of the prepared pans. Roll the dough ball
        in the oil to coat it all over, forming a rough ball. Repeat with the
        remaining piece. Let the dough balls rest for 3 to 4 hours depending on
        the temperature of your kitchen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat it to 220°C. If using
        the rosemary, sprinkle it over the dough. Pour two tablespoons of oil
        over each round of dough. Rub your hands lightly in the oil to coat,
        then, using all of your fingers, press straight down to create deep
        dimples. If necessary, gently stretch the dough as you dimple to allow
        the dough to fill the pan. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt all over.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the pans or pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes,
        until the underside is golden and crisp. Remove the pans or pan from the
        oven and transfer the focaccia to a cooling rack. Let it cool for 10
        minutes before cutting and serving; let it cool completely if you are
        halving it with the intention of making a sandwich.
