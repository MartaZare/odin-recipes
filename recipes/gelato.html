    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500 ml milk</li>
      <li>250 ml double cream</li>
      <li>50 g sugar, plus 50 g</li>
      <li>4 egg yolks</li>
      <li>vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a saucepan combine the milk, cream, and 50g sugar over medium heat.
        Cook until the sugar dissolves, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a medium bowl whip the egg yolks with the remaining sugar
        using an electric mixer until the eggs have become thick and pale
        yellow, about 4 minutes. Pour 120ml of the warm milk and cream mixture
        into the egg mixture and stir. Add this mixture back into the saucepan.
        Cook over very low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes
        thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, about 7 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a strainer over a medium bowl and pour the warm custard mixture
        through the strainer. Stir in the vanilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chill mixture completely before pouring into an ice cream maker and
        follow manufacturer's instructions to freeze.
